# linux-config

My linux configs for bspwm, sxhkd, polybar, rofi and dunst.

## bspwmrc:  
Uses:
- [picom](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom): adds nice compositor effects and animations for windows
- [nitrogen](https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen): a great wallpaper manager for use with bspwm
- [tint2](https://github.com/o9000/tint2): a small and lightweight application icon panel
- [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar): a bar for displaying system information

## sxhkd:
Uses:
- [xfce4-terminal](https://github.com/xfce-mirror/xfce4-terminal): my terminal of choice
- [flameshot](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot): for taking screenshots
- Thunar (will replace with nautilius)

## polybar:
- [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) (icons have limited compatibility on arch :/. need to find alternative)
- [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl): for use with polybar to make a media controller/display
- [zscroll](https://github.com/noctuid/zscroll): for adding a scrolling text feature to the network module (can also add to playerctl module)

## rofi:
Config is WIP.

## dunst:
Config is also WIP.

## Colour config help:
- [color-picker](https://github.com/Jack12816/colorpicker): copies pixel hex values to clipboard.
- [xev](https://github.com/freedesktop/xev): useful for finding the name of certain keystrokes (i.e for sxhkd config)



## Custom scripts:
- zscroll for polybar network module
- dunst volume script for volume bar in dunst notification
- playerctl script for grep'ing the name of currently playing song and play/pause button.
- rofi power menu
- rofi wifi menu
